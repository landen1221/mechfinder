        <p>The Customer and Mechanic shall enter into a Contract regarding what obligations must be performed in order for the Mechanic to receive payment. When committing to this contract, mechanics are bound to their warranties and guarantees they have stated within their profile. This contract will also be bound to any potential fees or charges for both customers or mechanics for failing to comply with &ldquo;Contract Guidelines.&rdquo; These fees may be applied, adjusted, changed, or altered at any time by the complete discretion of MechFinder.com. </p>
        <p>To assure a secure transaction, prior to the Mechanic&rsquo;s performance, the Customer shall be required to remit payment to be securely stored in a BrainTree escrow account. Payment will be released to the mechanic once both parties have agreed that the service/project has been completed. Upon the release of payments,a commission will be retained by Mechfinder.com in accordance with our &ldquo;MechFinder Fees&rdquo; which may be adjusted, changed, or altered at any time by the complete discretion of MechFinder.com. </p>
        <p>If a Customer believes that a Mechanic has failed to perform their obligations, or if a customer is withholding funds rightly due to the mechanic, then either or both of the parties may file for a resolution of a specific project. Upon filing a resolution, both parties will be given 48 hours to come to a mutual agreement before MechFinder.com administrators get involved to assist in the resolution. </p>
        <p>MechFinder administrators will review documentation provided by both parties, and will present a mutual non-binding resolution. Decisions may include, but are not limited to; releasing the Mechanic from their responsibility to the Customer, ordering the Mechanic to refund the Customer, order the customer to release funds due to the mechanic, sanctioning the Mechanic&rsquo;s account, or in some cases, identifying a partial release of funds for work that has been completed. </p>

Users are hereby declared as having the third party right to enforce the terms of this Agreement only to such extent that it is necessary to enforce an administrator&rsquo;s ruling. Should both parties fail to come to an agreement, or withhold the resolution presented by MechFinder, then the parties may elect to settle their dispute in arbitration. The users are responsible for all costs associated with arbitration. Excessive adverse findings by Mechfinder.com against either a Customer or Mechanic may result in the termination of that User&rsquo;s account. </p>
        <p>All payments between Customers and Mechanics are subject to the commissions, fees, and other conditions posted on the Site and contained in this Agreement. In the case of a difference between payment terms on the Site and this Agreement, the term most favorable to Mechfinder.com shall take precedent.</p>
        <ol start="8">
        <li><strong> Disintermediation</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Customers and Mechanics who come into first contact with each other through Mechfinder.com must not attempt to circumvent paying Mechfinder.com&rsquo;s fees by transacting business outside of Mechfinder.com within the first three years of discovering each other, or making contact through Mechfinder.com.</p>
        <p>MechFinder.com will only protect transactions that are booked through MechFinder.com. Any transaction which circumvents MechFinder will not be protected by our warranties, guarantees, insurance, or support. This includes, but is not limited to, projects fully completed outside of MechFinder.com, additional work performed by a hired mechanic in excess of that which he was hired for through MechFinder.com, and using a mechanic found through MechFinder.com for future work without running the transaction through the website. </p>
        <p>MechFinder.com reserves the right to block a customer or mechanic who we believe is circumventing MechFinder.com for business. These penalties may result in a temporary restriction from the website, or a permanent removal of an account and a permanent ban of a user from MechFinder.com. </p>
        <ol start="9">
        <li><strong> MechFinders relationship with Mechanics</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Mechfinder is not a party to the transaction between the Mechanic and Customer and does not provide tools, education, transportation, or a workplace for any Mechanic. MechFinder is not an employer, has no control over, and makes not representation as to the quality or legality of any services provided by a Mechanic. MechFinder cannot guarantee the truth or accuracy of any listing by a Mechanic, nor can it guarantee any Mechanics qualifications or background. It is important to understand MechFinder does not have any control over the conduct of any Mechanic, Customer, or other user of the Website and/or Service and therefore disclaims all liability to the maximum extent permitted by law. </p>
        <p>In addition to the above, you agree that your use of the Site or Service will : (i) not violate any contract you have entered into with any third parties; (ii) will be in compliance with all applicable laws; (iii) you will take all necessary precautions when services are being performed, specifically that the services are being conducted in an environment suitable to the work being performed. MechFinder disclaims any liability associated with any parties failure to secure a safe and appropriate work environment. </p>
        <ol start="10">
        <li><strong> Nature of Financial Accounts</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Any money paid to Mechfinder.com is not a deposit insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other entity, nor is Mechfinder.com a bank or other financial institution, nor does Mechfinder.com hold any money in trust on behalf of Users. Rather, money paid through Mechfinder.com is ran entirely through BrainTree. This money is held in an escrow account which is bound by the contract the customer and mechanic have created, and by the rules, regulations, and terms of this Agreement and any other document supplied by us or BrainTree.</p>
        <p>For example, if you are paid by another User for services rendered, you will not have a separate financial account opened in your own name with any particular financial institution, nor will any money be held in trust for you, but you will instead incur a right to be paid that amount of money by Mechfinder.com or BrainTree.</p>
        <p>Mechfinder.com and/or BrainTree may impose a delay on the payment of funds to you as a matter of routine, or in circumstances where it believes that there is a high risk involved of fraud, money laundering, or other unlawful activity. We may charge a fee for the payment of funds, which we will publicize on our Site.</p>
        <ol start="11">
        <li><strong> Chargebacks</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Where a User provides payment to Mechfinder.com, and that amount of money is subsequently taken from Mechfinder.com due to a chargeback, credit card cancellation, or other action that is the fault of the User, Mechfinder.com is entitled to recover that amount from the User.</p>
        <p>Additionally, should a chargebacks occur while funds are still held in BrainTree, Mechfinder.com may cancel the Contract, release the funds to the mechanic, and then debit the account of the Mechanic as a full or partial payment for such an event, regardless of whether the Mechanic has already completed all or part of its obligations to the Customer under the Contract. The Mechanic shall be responsible for exercising its legal remedies in relation to the non-payment by the Customer.</p>
        <p>Users agree that both the Customer and Mechanic in relation to a Contract are jointly and severally liable to Mechfinder.com for any event described in this section, as Mechfinder.com is not able to determine whether a chargeback or similar measure is conducted solely on the part of a Customer, or in concert with a Mechanic to defraud Mechfinder.com.</p>
