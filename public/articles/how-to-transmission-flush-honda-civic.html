<h2>How to do a transmission flush on a Honda Civic 1998 to 2000</h2>
<p>Here is a guide to changing transmission fluid on Honda civic. This is a simple DIY task and highly recommended to do every 2 years or 30,000 miles. </p>
<p>Always use factory recommended fluids or equivalent. You may want to step up to synthetic fluids although it’s a higher cost it preserves the inner workings much better than standard oil or hydraulic fluid and also provides a smoother operation</p>
<p>What is needed:</p>
<ul>
	<li>7 quarts fresh trans fluid –ATF Z1 Honda brand (AFT III can also be used) </li>
	<li>Jack</li>
	<li>4 jack stands</li>
	<li>Rubber gloves</li>
	<li>Shop towels</li>
	<li>3/8 ratchet</li>
	<li>Small/medium size funnel</li>
	<li>Drain pan</li>
	<li>Shop light</li>
</ul>
<p>Procedure:</p>
<p>If Automatic</p>
<ul>
	<li>Locate level surface to park vehicle</li>
	<li>Locate secure jack point and raise vehicle</li>
	<li>Place jack stands in a secure location on 4 corners of the vehicle (make sure they are level as well) and make sure that vehicle is stable and secure, it is always a good idea to keep jack under load after lowering onto stands</li>
	<li>Locate transmission drain plug</li>
	<li>Using ratchet (no socket needed) loosen drain plug </li>
	<li>Place drain pan under drain bolt and loosen by hand (note new fluid is red while old and used will probably be brown if not black)</li>
	<li>Clean magnetic drain bolt of any sediment using shop towel/rag (not if threads are damaged, if so source and replace)</li>
	<li>Replace plug and tighten </li>
	<li>From engine bay remove trans dip stick</li>
	<li>Using funnel add 3.1 quarts fluid</li>
	<li>Lower vehicle and drive for 15 minutes or until warm </li>
	<li>Repeat steps 1-10 (this allows for the fluid in the torque converter to be replaced as well)</li>
</ul>
<p>If Manual</p>
<ul>
	<li>Locate trans fill and drain plug</li>
	<li>Loosen fill plug first!!</li>
	<li>Loosen drain plug</li>
	<li>Drain into pan</li>
	<li>Clean plug</li>
	<li>Replace plug and tighten</li>
	<li>Using a transfer pump or funnel through engine bay fill transmission until fluid forms a stream from fill hole.</li>
	<li>Replace fill plug </li>
	<li>Lower vehicle, No need to repeat as all fluid has been exchanged.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always take all precautions into considerations when raising a vehicle and going under it. From routine oil changes to any other mechanical service the risk of the vehicle falling due to unsecure jacking points is real and can be fatal.</p>
