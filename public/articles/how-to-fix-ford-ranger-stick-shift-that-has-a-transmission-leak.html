<p>Ford Rangers with  a manual transmission can leak from a number of places. When determining a  leak, the first thing that you have to do is determine what is leaking. If  there is a spot or puddle of fluid under the truck, examine what is in the  puddle. If there is not a puddle, there might be drips hanging from the  transmission, a bolt or a line. It could be water, motor oil, brake fluid,  transmission fluid or gear oil if you have a 4x4. The water will just look like  dirty water. If it is motor oil it will feel thick and sticky and is usually  black. The brake fluid is almost clear and has a thin consistency. The  transmission fluid, when new, is red. It will have a red tint to it. It is not  as thick and motor oil, but not as thin as the brake fluid. The gear oil is  brown when new. Its consistency is between the transmission fluid and the motor  oil. It will feel thicker than the transmission fluid but not as sticky as the  motor oil.<br>
Once it is  determined what is leaking, next determine where the leak is coming  from.&nbsp;&nbsp;Look for the highest wet place on the transmission.</p>
<p>The Manual 5 speed  can be leaking either brake fluid or transmission fluid. If it is brake fluid a  drip will probably be hanging on the lowest point on the bell housing, where  the engine and transmission bolt together. Brake fluid could also be hanging  from the hose that runs into the side of the transmission on the driver&rsquo;s side  towards the front of the transmission. If this is the case, then the slave  cylinder is bad and the whole transmission will have to come out and the slave  cylinder will have to be replaced. If the clutch has a lot of miles on it, this  would be a good time to replace the clutch also.</p>
<p>If transmission fluid  is what is leaking, then determine where it is coming from. Again look for the  highest point on the transmission that is leaking. A few places that could leak  are: the output shaft seal, the speed odometer, or the front input shaft seal.  Any of these can leak, but one that is hard to catch is the shift rail plugs.  These are 3 little plugs that go in the back of the top of the transmission.  These little black rubber plugs will not leak much at a time, but leak just  enough to keep the back of the transmission wet. A lot of times it will look  like the speed odometer or rear output shaft is leaking.<br>
  It is not hard to  replace these plugs. Most people who change their own oil would be able to  replace these themselves.</p>
