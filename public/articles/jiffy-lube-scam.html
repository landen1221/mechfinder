<h2>Jiffy Lube Scam</h2>

<p>Mechfinder is here to inform you on all aspects of the automotive world, helping
you with our Do It Yourself guides, touching on the history of the automobile
and of course keeping up with the latest trends and news. Recently in there
automotive service industry there has been an abomination of sorts, as you may
have read or seen yourself Jiffy Lube has been caught red handed by a candid
individual with an expose on YouTube.</p>

<p>In this short film an individual marks his
oil filter or embarks on his journey to Jiffy Lube for a simple and routine oil
change having already marked and displaying to the audience the marked oil
filter, after paying and leaving the establishment he then reveals that the oil
filter had not been changed. The staff merely dropped the oil and exchanged it
with whatever was available on tap (literally it’s very similar to a Bar tap
system or a pump at the gas station).</p>

<p>Staining Jiffy Lube’s reputation
indefinitely is truly shocking performance; an establishment such as this that
churns out the oil changes should set a benchmark of quality and quick service.
Regardless of the legalities of their “oil change” of the fine print replacement
of the filter is absolutely an importance for it is what traps all the sediment
and soot that your oil contains. When the filter is overloaded with contaminants
it has a failure point just like everything else and sediment soon breaks
through and circulated in the system causing micro-scoring on the cylinder walls
or sludge build up inside.</p>

<p>Sadly they are not the only ones, nor is it the only
flaw. Many a time a young and under supervised/under educated “tech” will grab a
universal tool or an imprecise wrench or ratchet to remove a drain plug, and
stripping the head, or over tighten it stripping the threads. In the event of
such they will then replace the original drain plug with a quick fix, an
expanding drain plug or one with larger threads (this can become a serious
problem with modern day aluminum oil pans) and unbeknown to the consumer off
they go.</p>

<p>The way Jiffy Lube and the likes operate is by up selling, simply doing
oil changes is not profitable at all even at the special rates on bulk oil and
filters they cannot churn a profit by simply changing oil. Several options lead
to such negligence. On such scenario is that the company or location is not
making enough profit so they decide to save on filter costs by simply exchanging
fluids and not the filter (which begs the question of if they are even doing
that, and if so what kind of oil are they putting in your system). Another is
that the poor training (if any at all) that the staff receives will eventually
lead to negligent and or abusive behavior.</p>

<p>One could possibly argue that
mistakes happen and this is the nature of the beast, it’s true things can happen
after all were are human and we are prone to ere, however considering the odds
that an individual could gather physical evidence in the form of film, the odds
just don’t stack up that way. It’s one thing if you popped the hood in the
parking lot and said “hey, that’s the same old filter that was there before. I
put it on!” this is preemptive a strike at the industry, a strike that hit hard.
By no means do I want to instill distrust in the system or big box industries,
merely bringing to you knowledge of its prevalence and the importance of
knowledge, for knowledge is the only defense a consumer has.</p>

<p>So maybe buying
your oil and filter at the store costs a few bucks more? Why not do the work
yourself anyway? This way you can see the underside of your engine, check for
leaks, do a quick inspection over various components that you would rarely see
otherwise; not to mention knowing and having a choice of what exactly is going
into your vehicle. Some people disregard their vehicle and neglect it others
have pride and cherish theirs, regardless of whether its your daily “beater”,
your pride and joy or your garage queen; performing routine maintenance is key
to the survival of the vehicle and that’s what we are all about here at
Mechfinder.</p>
