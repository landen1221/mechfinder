<p><strong>How  to Repair a Leaking Head Gasket</strong><br>
Replacing the head  gaskets on any car or truck is kind of a gray area on whether or not to take it  to a professional. A lot depends on your mechanical abilities and tools. F150s  that are late 90&rsquo;s models and up are more difficult than some other head jobs  because either the motor has to come out or the cab has to be lifted off of the  chassis. It can be done either way, but most mechanics lift the cab off of the  chassis. Once the cab is lifted, or the motor is out, replacing the head  gaskets is the easy part. Most of the bolts and wires will be easier to get to.  When you remove these bolts, place them on a shop towel on a clean dry flat  surface in the order you remove them. This will help when you are looking for  bolts as you put all of the parts back in.<br>
<strong>Part  1 -- Remove the Head:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Drain  the air conditioning system with an approved recover, recycle, and recharge  machine.</li>
  <li>Disconnect  the Battery. Always disconnect the battery if you are working on a newer model  car. A newer model car is any car that has more electronics on it than spark  plugs, radio and lights. </li>
  <li>Drain  the engine coolant.</li>
  <li>Remove  the breather and plastic throttle body cover.</li>
  <li>Disconnect  the engine heater hoses from the engine.</li>
  <li>Remove  throttle body.</li>
  <li>Remove  fuel injectors. <strong>*NOTE: FUEL SYSTEM IS  UNDER PRESSURE!</strong></li>
  <li>Remove  the valve covers. </li>
  <li>Remove  the intake manifold.</li>
  <li>Remove  the exhaust manifold.</li>
  <li>Remove  the timing chain covers and timing chain.</li>
  <li>Disconnect  any remaining wires, bolts, hoses, or brackets that may be attached to the  head.</li>
  <li>Unbolt  the Head and it is ready to come off.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Part  2 -- Cleaning and inspection</strong><br>
  After the head is  removed, all of the engine, head, and intake manifold surfaces must be clean,  dry and free of gasket pieces, dirt particles, oil spots, and debris. You can  use a knife, scraper, file, or angle die grinder with a surface prep pad attached.  DO NOT use a grinding wheel on the die grinder. You must use a prep pad or  equivalent. After the head is cleaned, inspect it for warping. If you are  unsure, take the head to a machine shop and have it checked and possibly  shaved. Once you are sure the head is in good condition, it is time to start  putting everything back together.</p>
<p><strong>Part  3 -- Installation</strong></p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>Place  the head gasket on the dowel pins.</li>
    <li>Start  each cylinder head bolt. *NOTE: YOU MUST USE NEW HEAD BOLTS!</li>
    <li>Run  each head bolt down snug.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p>*<strong>IMPORTANT TIGHTENING  INSTRUCTIONS.</strong><br>
  <strong>HEAD BLOTS MUST BE TIGHTENED IN 3  STEPS IN THE CORRECT ORDER!</strong><br>

<p>Using  a torque wrench, follow the correct order and complete these steps:<br>
  Step  1:  Tighten each bolt to 30 ft. lbs. (40  Nm). Start with bolt 1 and work your way to bolt 10. <br>
  Step  2:  Tighten each bolt and additional ¼  (quarter) of a turn.  Start with bolt 1,  and end with bolt 10.<br>
  Step  3: Tighten each bolt another ¼ (quarter) of a turn. Start with bolt 1 ,and end  with bolt 10.</p>
<p><strong>Part  4 -- Finishing the job.</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Replace  any remaining wires, bolts, hoses or brackets that may have been attached to  the head.</li>
  <li>Replace  the timing chain and covers. (This would be a good time to replace timing  chains if they have not been replaced.)</li>
  <li>Install  doughnut or gasket and install the exhaust manifold.</li>
  <li>Install  the new intake manifold gasket and intake manifold.</li>
  <li>Install  the new valve cover gaskets and valve covers.</li>
  <li>Check  o-rings on fuel injectors, and replace o-rings if necessary. </li>
  <li>Install  fuel injectors.</li>
  <li>Install  throttle body.</li>
  <li>Install  heater hoses.</li>
  <li>Double  check for any wire, ground wires, hoses, bolts, or brackets they may have been  overlooked.</li>
  <li>Install  plastic throttle body cover and breather.</li>
  <li>Connect  the battery.</li>
  <li>Fill  the engine oil, coolant and refrigerant.</li>
  <li>Crank  the engine, and check for leaks.</li>
</ol>
