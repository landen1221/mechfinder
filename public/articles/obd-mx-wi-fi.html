  <strong>OBD (On Board Diagnostics)   MX-  Wi-Fi     </strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>GREAT NEW INVENTION!</strong>    &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s You Diagnose Your Car Yourself-At  Any Time&rdquo;<br>
Here is a Super new device created by OBD Solutions that  allows you to easily diagnose your car&rsquo;s electronic problems.  Discover what the real issue is when your  check engine light pops on.  Check your current  rate of fuel, your specific engine temperature, oil pressure and so much  more.  Takes only minutes to install,  with no tools required!<br>
<br>
This palm sized device, (1.97 x 1.77 x 0.91 inches), plugs  into any car or light duty truck&rsquo;s OBD port that was sold in the US from 1996  to current.   You just plug it into the OBD port, typically  found under the dash, and this device transmits whatever information is stored  in your cars computer over to any Wi-Fi enabled Cell Phone-Tablet or PC, giving  you total access, and allowing this info to become visible on your device.  Also, since the OBD has open end  architecture, besides informing you what the current status is, it also gives  you the ability to make changes to the current settings.<br>
<br>
The idea for this invention came up when the founders experienced  electronic car problems themselves and realized that there was no easy way to  diagnose problems.   Believing other  people had the same issues, they moved forward to create this remarkable  device.  The goal was to make is compact,  fast, easy to use, and yet secure and personal to the user.  Mission was accomplished!<br>
<br>
You can just plug it in to the OBD port, and leave it  plugged in without any drain on your battery since it shuts off when you turn  the car off, and comes back on after the engine is running again. Or just plug  it in when you feel like it and want to diagnose your car.<br>
 The readings are  &ldquo;real time&rdquo;, and 3 to 4 x&rsquo;s faster than other similar devices giving you more  accurate readings.  You can view your MPH-RPM-Fuel  Rate-Engine temp-MAF-Battery Condition and so much more.  You can even erase a check engine light  setting, and diagnose the problem yourself, so that when you go to your mechanic  you will already know what the problem is up front.<br>
<br>
It can also serve to lock or unlock doors and start engine  on certain newer GM vehicles, operating everything from your Smart Phone.  This device also provides mapping, and can  serve as a dashboard face through your Phone-PC or Tablet, telling you much  more than your standard built in gages do. Without the OBD you may see a light  come on in your dash, but what does it really mean specifically? With the OBD  plugged in, you will be able to see just what the real issue is. <br>
<br>
Also, think of the advantage when buying a used car.  Buyer Beware right?  Well, now you can just plug in your OBD, and  find out the condition of the car giving you info about the  engine-transmission-anti lock brakes-climate control and more.  You can even tell if a &ldquo;check engine light&rdquo;  code had been recently erased.<br>
<br>
Another feature is that this device will not heat up like some  imitator devices, and will work from temps as low as  -4 to +131 degrees F.   By the  way, no I am not a salesman for this company, I&rsquo;m just excited.  As a car enthusiast I can&rsquo;t even add up how  much money and time I have spent over the years on car problems using the costly  process of elimination.   This device  could have saved me a lot over the years.<br>
There is also a superior warranty.  Within the first 90 days, if you are not  pleased, or the OBD is not what you expected, you will receive a full refund.  After 90 days, you still have a 3 year  warranty.  Plus there are no monthly  fees-subscription fees-data plans or hidden costs.<br>
