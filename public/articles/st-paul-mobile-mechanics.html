<h3 align="center">St Paul Mobile Mechanics</h3>
<p>St,  Paul has become the most populous urban area in the state of Minnesota. This  area contains 182 cities and townships. The area has a human population of  3,422,264 according to the last recorded census, and a car population of 1,711,132,  not counting families with more than one vehicle, or commercial vehicles. There  has to be an auto mechanic available to take care of the needs of all of these  vehicles on the road, and since there are so many different types of vehicles  on the road, there is a need for mechanics that are capable of working on more  than one brand of the vehicle.<br>
  <br>
  All  of the cars on the roads in St. Paul face the same challenges with the weather  causing them to need periodic checks of fluids, belts, hoses, and tires. They  also all have the need for maintenance, and repairs, periodically. Most people  want their cars repaired as quickly as possible, because their busy lifestyles  will not allow them to sit around and wait for their car to get out of the  shop. The need for automobiles to be repaired as quickly as possible, has  provided a new service in the form of the mobile auto mechanic. The mobile auto  mechanic is revolutionizing the way that people in St. Paul get their car  maintenance taken care of, and has solved a huge problem for people who  experience mechanical failures and need help getting their vehicle running  again.<br>
  <br>
  The  mobile auto mechanic comes to where you are, assesses the situation you are  facing, and they either make immediate repairs for you on the spot, or they  have the car transported to the shop they work out of if the repairs are more  extensive. For simple maintenance issues like fluid checks, and minor tune-ups  you can actually schedule a mobile mechanic to come to your home, or place of  business and take care of the situation so that you never miss any time at  work, and your car is kept running at its best.<br>

  <br>
  Benjamin  has great labor rates on his services. He only charges $50 to do basic brake  service, and $25 to replace those pesky belts that like to break. He charges  $50 to replace the ball joints and $50 to replace an axle. He is also honest  with his customers about oil changes.
