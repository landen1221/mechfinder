<h2>Common Issues with Vehicles</h2>
<p>
    Whether you drive a car right off the lot, or are cruising around in a classic,
    one thing you can be sure of: something will break sooner or later.  With all
    those moving parts it's only a matter of time.  In this article we'll discuss
    common items that malfunction, even with proper maintenance.  Let's start with
    the most common.
</p>
<h3>1. Transmission</h3>
<p>
    Some are tougher than others and will last the life of a vehicle.  Some might
    need replaced or rebuilt two or three times in the same time span.  There are
    a few ways to tell if your transmission is in need of attention.  The most common
    is when your transmission begins slipping or just plain quits.  Slipping describes
    shifting that seems jerky, or rough.  You may not notice it when going from 
    Park to Reverse, but instead you might feel it as the vehicle is in motion.
    This could be solved by a tranny flush and filter change, but usually it means
    the gears are getting worn.  Checking your transmission fluid is vital.  The
    fluid is normally supposed to be red.  A darker shade or even brownish color
    means the fluid is being run hotter than it should, which could cause slippage.

<h3>2. Ball Joints and Tie Rods</h3>
<p>
    These control the steering of the vehicle.  Really not only just the ball joints
    and tie rods, but many other parts can malfunction or break that control you're 
    teering.  Although there isn't a fluid or oil you can just add to your vehicle
    to prevent breakages, there are a couple ways to ensure extra life of these
    parts.  One way is to avoid potholes, speed bumps and objects lying in the road.
    These put a huge amount of strain on your steering and suspension.  Another 
    way to possibly make your steering and suspension a part last a little longer
    is by watching for uneven tire wear.  Uneven tire wear means something is beginning
    to wear or has worn out.  If this is the case, have the part replaced as soon
    as possible to help the surrounding parts.

<h3>3. Electrical Problems and Malfunctions</h3>
<p>
    This could be anything from a burnt out headlight to that pesky window switch
    that doesn't work anymore.  Many people are afraid to tackle a simple fix such
    as a window switch or burnt out dash lights.  In newer vehicles it can be somewhat
    confusing, but it should not sway a person from proper maintenance.  Not only
    does it give a sense of accomplishment, but itâ€™s also for your safety, those
    in your vehicle with you, and those of us who share the road with you.  So please,
    feel free to ask people for help if needed.

<h3>4. Tires</h3>
<p>
    One of the most underestimated parts on a vehicle.  Not only do they have a 
    huge impact on how the vehicle handles and steers, but they also help during
    winter months on snow and ice, and even rain.  Worn tires are one of the most
    dangerous situations a person can have.  Have your tires checked regularly.
    It's wise to simply look at them and check the air pressure every week or so.
    Tires don't have to be used often to break down.  Even sitting in the garage
    for a couple weeks can cause damage.  Safety first folks, keep them checked!
