<p>Minneapolis, Minneaota has a flavored history of Industry and Wealth  with a population of approximately y 392,000 as of April of 2012.  The people that make up Minneapolis you can  bet are a tough breed, facing some of the most brutal winters in the Country, with  temperatures dropping well below zero on a regular basis.  The cars have to be tough too and kept up to  withstand these conditions.  Proper anti-  freeze, fresh oil along with all vital fluids must be kept up to par.  Your wind shield wiper solvents must be ready  to flow at all times, and let&rsquo;s not forget about those batteries that must be  able to crank when you need them to. Plus what about the importance of having  properly operating brakes for smooth stops on those icy roads. <br>
