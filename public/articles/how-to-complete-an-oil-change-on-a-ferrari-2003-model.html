<h3 align="center">How to Complete an Oil Change on a Ferrari 2003 Model</h3>
<p>A Ferrari is a superbly engineered car and careful handling is required while servicing this fantastic vehicle. Changing the oil of a Ferrari is not such a difficult task, although it may be a bit more involved compared to changing the oil in other cars. Hence, be patient if you are doing it for the first time, and you will get the hang of it with repetition.</p>
<p>Draining the old oil is the most difficult task in this endeavor, while filling in the new oil is quite straightforward. Use the proper tools and items required for the oil change and do not force anything into place roughly. All the items listed are supposed to fit into place, and if you feel there is a problem, take some time to figure out what is causing the obstruction and do not force anything. All the parts only fit one way.</p>
<p><strong>Equipment, Tools, and Supplies Required</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>10 quarts of Mobile 1</li>
  <li>Oil filter</li>
  <li>Copper washer for oil drain plug (if required)</li>
  <li>Drain pan capable of holding 10 quarts</li>
  <li>3/8 inch 6pt socket that is 17mm deep</li>
  <li>Strap Wrench</li>
  <li>Torque Wrench</li>
  <li>Stop blocks for wheels</li>
  <li>Floor jack with stand</li>
  <li>Funnel for pouring oil</li>
  <li>Tape</li>
  <li>Ziploc bag</li>
  <li>Paper towels and newspaper sheets</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>First, start the Ferrari to warm it up a little. This helps in suspending any debris present, and when you flush the compartment, the oil will come out easier. But not for too long, you do not want to do this when the engine is hot for many reasons. For one, you do not want the oil to burn you since you will most likely get some oil on your hand in this process. You do not want to change your oil immediately after you have been driving it for example.</li>
  <li>To protect the paintwork, you can raise the hood and drape soft towels on the painted surface so when you lean over the fender you will not blemish the paint at all. Use some tape to keep the towels in place.</li>
  <li>The drain pan has to be able to hold 10 quarts and you need to lift or jack up the vehicle to accommodate this process. Secondly, the lifted angle will improve drainage, since the release plug is on to the right side of the pan. So you should put the stop blocks on the front wheels, and set the jack under the frame rail to lift the rear left of the car. Position the stand, and set the car in place. </li>
  <li>Locate the correct oil drain plug, which will have markings of &ldquo;Oli Motore&rdquo;. This plug is a 17mm hex bolt with a horizontal orientation. Access to the plug is from the front side of the rear wheel. (Another plug that could confuse you is for transmission oil, which is an allen-head plug which is comprised with a vertical orientation.)</li>
  <li>Spread many newspaper sheets down and place the drain pan in place.</li>
  <li>Try loosening the plug slightly. The plug has an RH thread, and it is usually screwed tightly in place. Once you have loosened the plug, the oil will start draining quickly and may splash. To avoid this, you can regulate the outflow by loosening the plug slowly. If you are in a rush, you may make a mess on your garage floor and all over your hand and arm.</li>
  <li>Once the flow has slowed down, remove the oil cap for venting the engine.</li>
  <li>Use the strap wrench to remove the oil filter, after you have packed several paper towels around the filter.</li>
  <li>While removing the oil filter, you might want to drain it first by punching a hole at the top, but usually a quality filter will not leak, and this step will not be necessary.</li>
  <li>Put a drop of oil on the rubber seal of the new filter and start screwing it in place with your hand. Then screw it in tightly with the strap wrench, until it is snugly in place. While doing this you can protect the white paint of the filter by covering it with a Ziploc bag but the paint on the filter matters very little since no one is going to see it anyway. You do not have to tighten this filter until you break your wrist anyhow. Some people tighten these so much they are almost impossible to get off – not necessary.</li>
  <li>The drain plug should be cleaned of any dirt sticking in the threads. If the copper washer is worn out or too dirty, replace it with a new one.</li>
  <li>Replace the plug into the oil compartment and fit it firmly in place with a torque wrench. Do not muscle up on this bolt plug, you do not want to destroy the threads.</li>
  <li>Wipe the fins of the oil compartment clean of any remaining oil. The full drain pan has to be carefully removed carefully to avoid spillage. You do not want to slop up your garage.</li>
  <li>The draining process is now complete, and your Ferrari can be lowered to the ground and the stop blocks can be removed from the wheels.</li>
  <li>For filling the new oil remove the fill spout cover and place the funnel in the opening. Usually the radiator funnel fits quite snugly in the spout. Fill up to nine quarts of the preferred oil. Do not put in too much oil.</li>
  <li>Look for any sludge or sediments on the fill spout cap. If there is any, clean it thoroughly before refitting it in.</li>
  <li>Start your Ferrari and check to see if there are any oil leaks near the filter seal or the drain plug. Let the car run for some time and shut it off. Check the oil level after about twenty minutes and see if you need more oil. Some cars may need a little more, if you want the oil level to come to the full mark on the dipstick.</li>
