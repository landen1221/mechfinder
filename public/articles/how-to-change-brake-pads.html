<h2>How to Change Brake Pads</h2>

<p>To begin this project or any other automotive project you
must enter with clear and open mind. Not all vehicles are the same and some
variation may need to be adapted "as you go". There is also a proper way to
perform service and an improper way; take your time and assess the situation
before talking something that is beyond you expertise or knowledge. Albeit this
is a tool designed to educate you on the process involved in a particular
service and/or guide you on performing such service in your home garage. </p>

<p>The most important part is to be patient!</p>

<p>Note: unlike wine, vehicles age with the enemy,
corrosion; this is a fact that you may have to deal with, don't force something
if its not working you need to step back and approach it with a different angle.</p>

<p>Tools/items that you will need:</p>

<ul>
    <li>1x Can of brake parts cleaner</li>
    <li>2x Packets (or 1 jar) of brake lubricant</li>
    <li>Basic tool set (most newer vehicles use primarily Metric sizes however bother are used)</li>
    <li>Jack</li>
    <li>Jack stands</li>
    <li>Disposable latex gloves</li>
    <li>Shop towels</li>
    <li>Brake press (available at any parts store and ranging in
    price/quality also avail. As a rental tool) not a necessity but makes the job
    easier.</li>
    <li>and of course new brake pads!</li>
</ul>

<p>Directions:</p>

<ol>
    <li>To
    begin raise the hood and unscrew the brake fluid reservoir (inspect the fluid,
    it should be clear mineral spirit *blue if performance*. If it is brown or
    yellowish that means it is oxidized and has lost its efficiency and recommended
    to flush.</li>
    <li>Break loose the lug nuts/bolts DO NOT REMOVE COMPLETELY just break them loose. </li>
    <li>Locate
    a firm and secure jack point to raise the vehicle. Again locate and place an
    equally secure location for jack stands. </li>
    <li>Loosen
    lug nuts/bolts fully and remove wheel</li>
    <li>Take
    time to assess the work area and visually inspect shocks/struts and surrounding
    components for any wear or damage.</li>
    <li>On the rear of the caliper there are two (2) bolts. These are your caliper guides.</li>
    <li>Remove the guides and inspect they should be loose and well lubricated if not clean
    with brake cleaner and possibly sand off corrosion with a fine grit sand paper
    so they are smooth. If need be replacements are available for relatively low
    cost (some GM trucks come with pad set as they are single use) </li>
    <li>The caliper should be free from the caliper bracket at this point (you may need to
    pry it off with a small pry bar or larger flat screw driver as there is
    remaining brake pressure on the pads).</li>
    <li>Once removed inspect all components visually, brake rotor should be smooth ad
    without any waves or ridges. (if your brakes were pulsating, the disc will
    require replacement) </li>
    <li>If the discs are grooved they can be resurfaced at a local machine shop or various parts stores
    offer this service as well. Before this measure using a brake measuring
    caliper.</li>
    <li>Inspect pads for
    uneven wear (most commonly caused by lack of lubrication) </li>
    <li>remove one pad
    (retain the pad that is backed by hydraulic piston)</li>
    <li>Use caliper press or
    large pliers pressed against old used pad to return piston fully into housing
    (some brake fluid may seep out of reservoir above do not be alarmed this is
    normal) </li>
    <li>Remove remained pad</li>
    <li>Compare old pads to new make sure the pads you have are the correct ones.</li>
    <li>New pads in hand use
    lubricant to lubricate all surface the pad contacts (other than friction
    surface of rotor) this will allow for a smooth and quiet operation. Try not to
    let lubricant come onto pads functional friction surface, if this does occur
    use brake cleaner generously to remove.</li>
    <li>Insert pads into caliper or place into caliper bracket.</li>
    <li>Place caliper in position. </li>
    <li>Lubricate guides </li>
    <li>Place into position and tighten. Torque specs are available but if not tighten to hand tight (within reason)</li>
    <li>Use brake cleaner and shop towels to remove and excess grease or residue from lubricant. Be liberal.</li>
    <li>Install wheel and tighten lugs.</li>
    <li>Lower vehicle and retighten lugs. Toque specs are recommended.</li>
    <li>Pads today are almost
    always chamfered and "pre-broken in" but if you would like to ascertain this,
    utilize the 30-30 rule which means 30 stops in 30 feet; this allows the brakes
    to run through a full heat cycle and set.</li>
    <li>Your done!</li>
</ol>

<p>Important note: if brake fluid
happens to flow out you must clean it up immediately and if at all possible do
not allow it to touch painted surfaces (it is highly corrosive and WILL strip
you paint)</p>

<p>If you have multi pot (two or more
pistons per caliper) you will need to adapt a slightly different method.</p>
