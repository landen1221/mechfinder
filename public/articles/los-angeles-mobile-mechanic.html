  The  majority of the time when you have trouble with your car you have to take the  car to the service technician. Many times this means you have to hire a tow  truck to take your vehicle to the service technician and pay that extra towing  cost. When you have your car worked on by Ben Alcazar he comes to you. You save  the headache of having to arrange for towing, you avoid the possibility that  your vehicle could be damaged by the towing company and you save yourself from  doing further damages to your vehicle when it is having problems by driving it  unnecessarily. <br>

Ben  is a highly trained automotive service technician who is capable of fixing most  of the problems your car may have. The majority of the time he is doing basic  car repairs, or maintenance work on vehicles. This is because when people have  the convenience of having their mechanic come to them, they are quicker to call  them. When people have to drive their car to the mechanic, they usually have to  take off of work to do so and they tend to put off the visit to the automotive  shop until they simply have to go. This means their vehicle problems get worse  and they wind up costing more to repair. Ben is called out when the problems  are still in the beginning stages, before they become major repairs, most of  the time.</p>
