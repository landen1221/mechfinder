  <strong>LaFerrari;  Automotive Paragon</strong><br>
  No other automaker has achieved such recognition as  Ferrari.  Although many competitors have  arisen throughout the ages, not a single company has even come close to  matching the power, the speed, the beauty or the exclusivity Ferrari exudes  year after year.  The athletic Ferrari  360 Challenge, the breathtaking Ferrari Testarossa and the fabled Ferrari Enzo  have unrelentingly pulled at the heartstrings of car fanatics everywhere.  Their latest creation is no different.  Let me introduce you to the captivating  LaFerrari.<br>

  On the new LaFerrari, not a single element seems out  of place.  The flowing, curvaceous lines  and the gaping, hungry ducts gracefully interact to create a sense of fierce  beauty.  Although the LaFerrari seems  like an artist&rsquo;s masterpiece, it secretly is an engineer&rsquo;s brainchild.  The front wing combined with the smooth  underbody and rear diffuser help to create racecar-like levels of  downforce.  The rear spoiler adds to this  effect by keeping the immensely powerful rear end of the LaFerrari planted  through the apex of high speed turns.   Compared to the Ferrari Enzo, the ride height of the LaFerrari was  lowered by 30mm and the width was decreased by a sizeable 40mm.  The amalgamation of these F1 inspired  features results in a shockingly low drag coefficient of 0.3.  <br>

  Yet in the LaFerrari, beauty is not merely skin  deep.  Lurking beneath the glistening red  paint, a carbon fiber exoskeleton is the backbone of this engineering  marvel.  No less than four different  types of aircraft grade composites were used in the construction of the  LaFerrari.  The new structural tub  exceeds the Ferrari Enzo&rsquo;s torsional rigidity and beam stiffness by 27 percent  and 22 percent respectively.  Even with  all the increased chassis strength, engineers at Ferrari have managed to  decrease overall weight by a staggering 20 percent.  The redesigned dampers, control arms, and  braking system results in shaving off a whopping 5 seconds from the Enzo&rsquo;s lap  time.<br>

  Most motor-heads just want to know what resides  under the LaFerrari&rsquo;s ducted bonnet, and fortunately for us, Ferrari is not one  to disappoint.  Peering into the rear  mounted engine bay, one&rsquo;s eyes are drawn to the voluminous, twin-ducted intake  manifold feeding a massive twelve cylinders.   This V12 makes an astounding 789 horsepower at a lofty 9250 revolutions  per minute.  For such a high strung mill,  the V12 makes a hearty 663 foot-pounds of torque.  It is the most powerful V12 engine Ferrari  has ever put inside a production vehicle.<br>
  <br>
  If that was the only thing under the hood, the  LaFerrari would still be one of the most impressive road-going vehicles ever  produced, but Ferrari didn&rsquo;t stop there.   Coupled with the carnal V12 is a HY-KERS hybrid kinetic energy recovery  system.  Using technology from their F1  KERS system, the HY-KERS integrates a 161 horsepower electric motor and a 132  pound battery pack, which is the equivalent of 40 regular sized car batteries  at a fraction of the weight.  The battery  pack is cooled by its own cooling system to ensure maximal discharge  performance.  <br>

  The combination of the screaming V12 and the  electrifying HY-KERS system culminate in a 0 to 60 mph of less than 3  seconds.  Also 0 to 190 mph arrives in  less than 15 seconds.  The top speed is  said to be over 220 mph.  Only 499 of  these models were produced at a price of 1.3 million dollars.  The LaFerrari supply was depleted before the  model even debuted in March.  This car,  the Ferrari LaFerrari will be one for the history books.</p>
