<h2>History Of Goodyear</h2>

<p>Today's Goodyear centers are full-service automotive maintenance facilities that offer every repair service you'll ever need. When you think of Goodyear, you think of tires. But there is more to the Goodyear story than, as they say, "meets the road."  </p>
<p>In 1898, Frank A. Seibering made a whopping (and questionable) investment of $3,500 in borrowed money to purchase a plant that would become a household word. The 38-year-old predicted that the cotton and rubber transported from around the world were the components of tires, and that The Goodyear Tire & Rubber  Company could revolutionize the production of what was to become a staple to American life.</p>
<p>Although Charles Goodyear, who discovered vulcanization, died penniless, the company bears his name. And the Goodyear blimp (there are three of them in North America in operation since 1925), are ambassadors of the name and part of major events like the Daytona 500 and the NFL Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Goodyear is synonymous with quality tires, but it has become so much more. When you pull into an automotive center bearing the name Goodyear, you know your car will be road worthy and maintained n a manner that extends its life and safety. Of course there is the tire, rotation, alignment and other specifics dealing with the undercarriage and the actual "ride."</p>
<p>Developing the finest in tires, from the original rubber to a line of steel-belted radials in a range of sizes for various vehicles, wheel bases and driving needs, Goodyear Tires are world-renowned for their quality and long service. These are the tires of champions, and Goodyear is a well-known name in such motorsports as NASCAR and other auto racing leagues, as well as motorcycle and cross-country racing. Four wheelers rely on Goodyear, and all motors depend on maintenance.</p>
<p>But oil changes are perhaps the single most important key to auto maintenance.
