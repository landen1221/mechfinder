<h2><strong>How To Remove Acid Rain Stains From  Your Car Windshield</strong></h2>

<p><br>
When that  acid rain comes down from the sky, splattering pollutants from the air onto  your car windshield, you will find it doesn&rsquo;t just wipe off with some Windex or  your typical windshield washer solvent.   This type of rain leaves stains, and you need to be aggressive to get  rid of them.<br>
Besides acid  rain, your windshield picks up other debris, including insect remain stains  which may stain as well.  Glass will also  dull and yellow from road film over time.  This article will show you how to easily deep  clean your windshield and get it back to where it should be.  This treatment, which I have done myself many  times should take no more than about 1 hour of your time for a cost of under  $10., which will leave plenty of extra material for future treatments.<br>

<strong>Supplies Needed:</strong><br>
-Very Fine  Rubbing Compound<br>
-Terry Cloth  palm size wax applicator (1-2)<br>
-Clean Water  in a pail or a water hose<br>
-Small  amount of common dish soap<br>

-Clean soft  cotton rags (old T-shirts work well)<br>

<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Wash down your windshield with clean water  and maybe a small amount of common dish soap. Get rid of any debris so you have  a smooth surface. If you have any grit or coarse debris on the windshield while  performing the treatment you can push these fragments around and possibly cause  scratching of the glass.</li>
  <li>Wet down with your sprayer or hose a  small section of the windshield you want to start with. Wet an approx. 12 x 12  &ldquo; section for starters.</li>
  <li>Wet your terry cloth applicator, and  ring out the excess water.</li>
  <li>Apply about 1 teaspoon of the rubbing  compound to the center of the applicator.</li>
  <li>Working in a circular motion with  firm pressure, rub the compound thoroughly onto your work area. Always make  sure the window and the applicator is wet &ldquo;at all times&rdquo;.  As you see the compound begin to dry and  cake, rinse the applicator completely, getting rid of the old compound. Then re  soak your applicator, wring out, and apply another teaspoon of fresh compound.  If your applicator becomes too flat and dirty after a while, switch to a new  applicator.</li>
  <li>Once you have completed a section, rinse  off with clean water to view your work and see if you missed any areas.  Work a little extra on harder stains that may  be tougher to eliminate.</li>
  <li>Continue to work your way over the  entire windshield. You don&rsquo;t want to leave any areas undone, which would then stand  out.  The goal is to go over every inch  of the windshield.</li>
  <li>Rinse down the windshield completely  when you have finished, and dry with a soft clean rag or towel.  Then take a good look and see if there are  any remaining stains, which may need a retreatment. </li>

<p><strong>Notes and Interesting  Facts:</strong><br>
  -The compound&rsquo;s job is to get in deeper than your common  glass cleaners could ever do, getting back to the original surface of the  glass.  <br>
  -Acid rain is really pollutants in the air that the rain  picks up on it&rsquo;s way down from the raincloud it originated from.<br>
  -To help keep a clear windshield, it&rsquo;s always a good idea to  change your rubber wiper blades often. Worn or missing rubber leaving the metal  frame of the wiper arm to touch the glass is a sure way to create permanent  scratches on your windshield.<br>
  -A product like Rain-X for instance, is great to treat your  windshield with on a regular basis. It&rsquo;s protectants will help acid rain and  debris from ever reaching the actual glass surface.</p>
