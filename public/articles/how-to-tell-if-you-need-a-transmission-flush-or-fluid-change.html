<p>The transmission  fluid is the life of the transmission. A transmission fluid change or flush is  preventative maintenance not a fix.  A  transmission has lots of moving parts the rub against each other all the time.  This causes friction. Friction causes heat. Heat is the main cause of  transmission trouble. Transmission fluid breaks down with heat. Different makes  and models require different types of fluid and different intervals for changing  or flushing the transmission.  I would  recommend changing or flushing your transmission fluid according to your  driving habits. If you live in the city and your transmission is constantly  changing gears up and down between stop lights I recommend having your  transmission fluid changed or flushed every 30,000. If you live out in the  country or drive long distances with out stopping you will be fine changing  your fluid every 50,000 miles. If you wait and go over 100,000 miles without  changing your transmission fluid, you are taking a chance when you do finally  change it. Sometimes, you can do more harm than good when you go that long  without changing you fluid.</p>
<p>Most people don't  think about changing their transmission fluid until they hear a noise, the  transmission shifts funny, or it quits. Then, they want change their fluid and  fix the problem. Some people get lucky and a fluid change or flush will take  care of the problem for a while.</p>
<p>A transmission  fluid change or flush is preventative maintenance not a fix. Depending on your  make and model, the filter may not be able to be changed. Some transmissions do  not have a bottom pan and there is no access for the filter. In this case, a  flush is all you can do. If there is access to the filter through the bottom  pan, I recommend changing the filter and flushing the transmission.  </p>
<p>A flush has to be  done at a shop that has the equipment to flush the transmission.  Most machines hook up to both of the  transmission cooler lines. When the car is running, one line pumps new fluid in  and the other line catches the old fluid as it comes out.  This gets all the fluid out of the pan,  inside the transmission, torque converter, lines and cooler. It flushes the  whole system. This is the only way to change all the transmission fluid in the  transmission. For a little extra, most shops will do a flush and replace the  filter.</p>
<p>A fluid and filter  change only changes about half of the fluid in the transmission. When you drop  the bottom pan you only change the fluid that is in the pan, but most of the  time you have access to the filter. You also get to see if there are any metal  flakes, shavings or debris in the pan. If you are having problems you might  want to have a look in the pan the see what it looks like.</p>
