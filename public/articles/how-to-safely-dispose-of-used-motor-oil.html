<p>If you change your engine oil on your own, you are  going to end up with quarts of dirty oil each time. Now the question comes up  how this used motor oil must be disposed of in an environmentally safe manner?</p>
<p>However, before you address this question, you should  know that used motor oil still has some value left in it. If you deposit this  oil with a recycling collection center, it will help save energy and reduce the  global carbon footprint. </p>
<p><strong>How to Transport  Used Motor Oil</strong></p>
<p>The safest way to transport used motor oil from your  home is to carry it in your car. As a first step, carefully transfer the  contents from the oil drain pan to some clean and empty gallon jugs. If the  drain pan does not have a built-in spout for pouring, you can use a funnel to  pour the contents. </p>
<p>You may even consider purchasing a drain pan that  comes with a sealable lid and spout. So you can carry the pan directly to the  recycling center. However, if you find the drain pan to be unwieldy or tough to  carry, particularly when it is full, you may use gallon jugs as a more  convenient alternative. </p>
<p><strong>Precautions During  Transit</strong></p>
<p>Make sure that the used oil has cooled sufficiently  before you transfer it to gallon jugs. You only have to worry about this if you  are changing the oil right after the car has been driven. The plastic jugs can  burst open or melt if you pour oil that is still hot enough. Once the oil has  been poured, take care to screw the cap onto the jug tightly or press it down  until it secures completely, there are different types of jugs and containers.  To prevent any chance of leakage that could spoil your car, you can place the  jug in a plastic garbage bag and tie-twist the bag. You can place a few layers  of old newspaper at the floor of your car before placing the jug on it. </p>
<p>In case you have a truck, you can place the oil jug  on the bed so that even if the jug does leak, it will not spoil the interiors  of the vehicle. In any case, make sure that the jug is securely fastened with  tie-downs or some heavy material to keep it in its place. Even so, drive gently  to your destination. In case you are going to transport the jug in your car,  avoid placing it in the trunk. The jug will most likely topple over or roll  around once you start driving. The passenger-side floor-pan is actually an  ideal place for this purpose. </p>
<p><strong>Where to Deposit  the Oil</strong></p>
<p>One of the easiest options that many people like to  choose is to carry the used motor oil to the nearest gas station that accepts  used oil for recycling. Some of the stations may charge a fee to cover their  handling costs. In some residential areas, public recycling bins are made  available for old motor oil as well. </p>
<p>If you need another option, particularly if you live  in a remote area, you may find out if someone uses an oil-fired commercial  stove to heat their place. Car workshops and other commercial outlets may be  glad to accept your used oil for free. You may even dispose of gear oil in the  same way and even mix it in with used motor oil. </p>
