<h2><strong>Finding a Mechanic  Online</strong></h2>

<p>What options do you have for finding a mechanic? You can  spend long hours browsing through a thick stack of white pages. You can go by  &ldquo;word-of-mouth&rdquo; referrals. You can also go out and track down your local  mechanics on foot! However, the most efficient way to find a mechanic is to  find a mechanic online. Free websites such as craigslist.org, mechfinder.com,  and repairpal.com have done an extraordinary job to provide customers with  great information and people. Collectively these sites offer: contact  information for mobile mechanics, local locations of quality repair mechanics,  mechanic ratings, and most importantly estimates/bids.  <br>
  <br>
Craigslist is a great place to find a listing of shops in  your area, of mechanics who are eager to find customers, and whom are open for  term discussions. Craigslist will also offer more variety than the white pages,  simply because not every business chooses to be listed in the books—but they&rsquo;ll  post an ad on craigslist. So while we are on the topic of &ldquo;listing things&rdquo;  let&rsquo;s list what you get when you work with craigslist. 1. New businesses  strongly enthused to build a loyal client base and 2. Established businesses in  search for new customers, and willing to negotiate. <br>
<br>
Mechfinder allows you to go direct to the mechanic instead of  using a shop. The auto repair revolution starts here.  When you post a project up on Mechfinder the mobile  mechanics will be instantly notified once you sign up as a buyer on the website.  In addition to that, they allow multiple mechanics to bid on fixing your  problems; sites like Mechance.com are entirely free and beneficial for  interested customers. Mechanics  are  going to try and win, by giving the best price possible, while keeping quality  in mind, because Mechfinder is secured by a rating system. Therefore, good bids  will stand out from bad quotes given by money hungry mechanics you are trying  to stay away from. Competition encourages all contestants to put their best  foot forward and mechanic ratings will allow you to really determine, and  narrow down who is a best fit for you. <br>

RepairPal goes above and beyond to provide comfort to their  customers. They rate top shops with Net Promoter Scores before adding them to  their large listing. Their process continues into an analysis for the cost of  parts and labor for repairs and zip codes where shops are located. Expert  technicians and data analysts spend efficient time to gather this information  and then the data is handed over to the RepairPrice Estimator, which calculates  estimated price ranges.  To follow up  with this superb performance RepairPal conducts background checks, annually  reassessments, and an 84-questionair assessment on potential shops.  To ensure that your money has been put in the  right hands they throw in a mandatory parts and labor warranty of 12 months or  12,000 miles for their customers. <br>
