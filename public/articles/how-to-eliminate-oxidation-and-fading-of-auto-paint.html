<h2><strong>How To Eliminate  Oxidation And Fading Of Auto Paint</strong></h2>

<p><br>
  <br>
  <strong><br>
  </strong><br>
Over time all automotive paint fades due to age and  oxidation, which is caused by the sun&rsquo;s ultra violet (UV) rays.   The  paint will look dull, and not be as bright and shiny as it used to be.  You may not need a new paint job to get that  luster and finish back if you follow the simple steps below.  <br>
You can do this job yourself in about 3-4 hours, and for a  cost of around $40. for the materials, along with an extra approx. $35. for the  purchase of a &ldquo;Orbital Buffer&rdquo;, if you don&rsquo;t already have one, and get  excellent results, bringing that shine back.  <br>
The purpose of this treatment is to gently cut through and  remove a thin layer of the existing surface paint or clear coat if any remains,  along with removing general debris, which will also dull the finish.  Keep in mind that there are numerous layers  of clear coat and paint on a car, and the object is to remove only a thin top layer.   You cannot buff a car too many times  before you remove all the paint. <br>
<strong>NOTE:</strong>  If the paint is gone completely and you are  looking at the primer below, or surface rust, this treatment will not solve the  problem. New paint may be required in these severe cases.</p>

<p><strong>STEPS:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li> Temperature  should be at least 55 degrees for this job. Wash your car and rinse well with  clean water.  All debris and grit should  be removed so the surface is smooth.  You  do not have to tape off any chrome or glass unless you would like to, using  common masking tape. This compound will not hurt any part of the cars exterior,  but will only end up with compound on them which is easily washed off.</li>
  <li>Apply a Terry Cloth Bonnet to the buffer making  sure it is on tight and pulled all around the edges. The bonnet surface that  will be placed on the surface should be without wrinkles.  Test run the buffer so you have an idea of the  torque involved and what motions to expect. &ldquo;Hold on tight&rdquo;.</li>
  <li>Apply approximately 1 to 2 tablespoons of  compound directly onto the bonnet with the buffer turned off.  The bonnet does not have to be covered in full  with the compound, but dabbed in a uniform way. In other words, don&rsquo;t put it all  on one side.</li>
  <li>Only work a maximum area of 2 feet x 2 feet at a  time, so pick the area you want to work on first. It is wise to pick an  inconspicuous area first to test your skills and also get a good idea of how  thick or thin your paint is on the car. (Keep in mind the paint will usually be  thinner on top surfaces, like trunk, hood and roof).  </li>
  <li>Place the buffer in the center of the area you  will be working on. DO NOT TURN THE BUFFER ON until it is placed firmly in  position on the car, otherwise the compound will spin and shoot the compound on  the bonnet into the air, and possibly in your eyes. (Safety Glasses are  suggested in any event). </li>
  <li>For areas such as painted side mirrors, edges of  vinyl bumper covers and spoilers, it is suggested to do these areas by hand.  Circular motion with small amounts of compound on a clean soft cloth will do  the job.</li>
  <li>Turn the buffer on &ldquo;only&rdquo; while firmly pressed  onto the car in the center of your work area. The object is to work the  compound gradually from the center of the section and then moving outward.   As you  see the compound dry, reduce pressure.  It  &ldquo;will&rdquo; take a little while to get used to the action of the buffer and what to  expect.  NEVER leave the buffer in the  same place for more than a few seconds at a time. It should &ldquo;always&rdquo; be kept  moving.  Take SPECIAL CARE while running  the buffer along edges or body lines. Avoid those areas or just run the buffer  over them with very quick passes. Leaving the buffer sitting too long on an  edge, or any spot for that matter, which could be just a matter of a few seconds,  can burn right through the paint. There is a &ldquo;developed touch&rdquo; for buffing, and  it requires constant focus.  <strong>NOTE:</strong>  If after you start buffing, you start to see  underlying primer, or the paint becoming too thin, you may want not to move  forward and take the chance of removing the little paint that remains.</li>
  <li>After you have worked a section and you do not  see the white compound being spread any longer, and looking dry and caking up,  it&rsquo;s time to TURN THE BUFFER OFF WHILE IT IS  STILL PRESSED ON THE CAR.  If you turn it  off after removed from the car the compound and debris will spin off into the  air.</li>
  <li>Apply more compound as needed to the bonnet,  using no more than 2 tablespoons at a time. You will notice the terry cloth  bonnet may be picking up the paint color and become flattened and dirty as you  go along. Using your judgment, when you feel the terry cloth bonnet is not doing  its job, then it&rsquo;s time to replace it.  </li>
  <li> To view  your work, wet it down using your trigger sprayer filled with clean water or use  a water hose, and wipe that section dry. Your eyes will tell you if you missed  any areas.  You should be looking at a  shiny smooth surface, with exception of possible light swirl marks or left over  compound.</li>
  <li>To remove swirl marks or left over compound, which  are most noticed on black or very dark finishes, you can usually rub them out  by hand using a dry cotton cloth.  You  can also purchase another compound from 3M, which is called Swirl Remover, and  can be applied with the same buffer, but you would use different bonnets, which  are made of soft foam.</li>
  <li>If you are happy with the finish, &ldquo;gently&rdquo; wash  the car again, using a very weak soap solution and soft cloths.  Keep in mind that the compound will still be  soft for a time, and rubbing too hard on the finish can cause uneven marks.</li>

<p><strong>Interesting  Facts:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>To help prevent oxidation in the future, wax  your car often using waxes that provide UV protection.</li>
  <li>Oxidation is most prominent in sunny states like  Arizona for instance, where the sun is very strong.</li>
  <li>Factory paint jobs in the US usually have 2-3  coats of paint and then 2-3 coats of clear coat. Custom expensive paint jobs  may have as many as 5 or more coats of paint and clear on them.</li>
