<h2><strong>How To Remove Cracks and Fading In Leather Car Interior</strong></h2>

<p><strong><br>
  </strong><br>
  The sun&rsquo;s UV (Ultraviolet) rays can destroy your leather  seats which are meant to be subtle and smooth, not faded, cracked and hard.  General aging will always take place no matter what you do, but when you add  oxidation from the hot sun to the aging process, your leather won&rsquo;t last very  long if you don&rsquo;t take very good care of it.<br>
If your leather seats have been victim to oxidation and  general wear you do have have choices. You could cover the seats with some  material, or spend a fortune to have them reupholstered with new leather.  I am going to show you a tried and true way  to nourish, bring life and color back to your leather, making is soft, smooth and  flexible once again.<br>
The treatment listed below should take no more than about 1  hour of your time and cost about $10. for the supplies you will need, and you  won&rsquo;t believe the results.</p>
<p><strong>Supplies Needed:</strong><br>
  -LEXOL LEATHER CONDITIONER      16.9 oz container will be more  than enough.<br>
  -Soft clean cotton rags.   Old cotton t-shirts will do just fine.</p>
<p><strong>Where to Buy  Supplies:</strong><br>
  Lexol Leather Conditioner      O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s Auto Parts or similar  parts store</p>
<p><strong>COST OF SUPPLIES:</strong><br>
  Approx. $10.</p>
<p><strong>STEPS:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Wipe  down and clean the leather removing any spots or stains that you possibly can.  Vacuuming is also a good idea to remove any debris and crumbs in the crevices.  A very small amount of common dish soap in  clean water will work to remove those sticky spots, maybe where that soda pop  spilled.  You may also use a very soft  bristle brush if needed.  The goal here  is to end up with a smooth clean surface.   The conditioner does not clean the leather, but only conditions it.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Apply  a liberal amount of Lexol on a soft clean rag. Start with roughly 1 tablespoon.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Starting  at the very top of the seat and working your way down, massage the product into  the leather, working an approx. 12x 12 inch area at a time. Really work it in  good, and continue to use more Lexol as needed, turning your rag as you go  along so you are working clean.  Be  generous with the product, the leather needs the nourishment, but no need to be  excessive.  Amounts used will depend on  the condition of your leather.  If it is  sorely dry, cracked and damaged, the leather will absorb more of the product.  Less damage or newer leather will require  less Lexol, so there are judgment calls on your part.  Always apply extra on hard and cracked  spots.  You will be amazed as how this  product will soften and expand the leather reducing the crack size.  Keep in mind that if the leather is  completely worn away in an area and you are looking at the underlining, that  this or any product I know of will do no good.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Once  the product is applied to all of your leather, wait approx. 30 minutes for the  Lexol to completely soak into the leather. Your wait time will depend on the  temperature of the air, humidity levels  and how much you applied.  The object is to wait long enough until any  excess product has pretty much disappeared.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>After  waiting as mentioned in the previous step, take a clean soft unused cloth and  buff off any of the excess oil, going over all of the areas where you applied  it. This is just to remove any oily residue that has not absorbed into the  leather by now.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Wait  at least an hour if possible before sitting on the seats.  If possible leave the windows open so fresh  air can come in and out of the car and increase the drying process.  Once buffed and dry you should immediately  see the difference and feel it too. The original color should be back, cracks  will be less defined and the leather should be soft, smooth and subtle to the  touch!</li>

<p><strong>Interesting  Facts and Notes:</strong></p>
<p>-It&rsquo;s a good idea to retreat with Lexol at  least 4 times per year, or every season change.   Especially retreat areas most vulnerable to direct sunlight. Typically  this would be the top of the back seats.   Also pay special attention to seats that are used often, like the driver  seat, as the product will wear away quicker there.<br>
-To preserve your leather try and avoid  perspiring on it.  A good example would  be sitting on the seats with shorts on while perspiring.  The salt from our sweat is one of leathers  worst enemies, drawing the moisture out of it, causing the leather to harden,  and making it more prone to cracking.<br>
-Oily hair tonics are another culprit. Once  the oil dries over the leather, the leather will not be able to breathe as long  as the oil is present, thus hardening and cracking may occur in that area. Keep  in mind that leather does need to breathe.<br>
-Proper care of your leather will allow it to  last as long as you want it to!  </p>
