<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Mechfinder is a website which is particularly integrated for you, the customer, to share information with whom you may choose to share. It is also up to you the customer to decide how much of this information that you want shared. We want you to feel comfortable to design that part of this website to your particular desires and needs. Since Mechfinder is more than a website but is also a social website, there are certain privacy settings that you choose which Mechfinder must adhere to when sharing such personal information.</p>

<p>In addition, Mechfinder is an absolutely free service which is primarily supported by advertising. It is our promise at Mechfinder that we will not share any of your personal information with those advertisers who support our website without your consent.</p>

You will also have the opportunity to provide Mechfinder with a profile picture, although this is not a requirement. There may be other personal information which you may choose to provide such as personal preferences in activities, religion, politics, or even job history. This, again, is not a requirement but you will be given the opportunity to add this data to your profile. This information will be given on a volunteer basis and you choose which you decide to divulge and what you do not want provided on Mechfinder.

Therefore we can track the information to provide a better quality in advertising through Mechfinder.</p>

<p>It is very important that your privacy is protected while using the Mechfinder website.
